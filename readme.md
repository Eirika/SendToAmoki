===========
Install
-------
* Windows :
	* Clone this repo
	* Go to : `[WINDOWS_DISK]:\Users\[YOUR_USER]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\SendTo`
	* Create a shortcut to pointing to `python "path_to_sendToAmoki.py"` with the quote !


* Linux :
	* Clone this repo
	* Dunno; Need Amoki's help here !


* In all case :
    * If you want to use the auto credential system, create a file exactly named `credentials.py` containing :
		
		```python
			conf_host = "URL / IP TO YOUR FTP HOST"
			conf_user = "YOUR USERNAME"
			conf_password = "YOUR PASSWORD"
        ``` 
        This file need to be located in the same directory of the script `sendToAmoki.py`

How to use
----------
* Windows :
	* Just right-click the file(s) or folder you want to upload and wait till the script print `FIN !`


* Linux :
	* Probably as simple as Windows but Amoki need to confirm
